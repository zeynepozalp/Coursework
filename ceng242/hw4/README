Sample IO for Homework 4

To use the sample IO please:
- Remove the parameter of function Game::playTurn().
- Add the method Game::getBoard() which is provided in the homework files.
- Receive Game::maxTurnNumber as the third line of input in InputParser.
- Add NO_GOAL to the Goal enumeration in Constants.h.

There are 3 .cpp files and a Makefile in the src folder. Copy them into the same
folder as your source codes. You can generate the test binaries using the commands:
- make testPlayer
- make testBoard
- make testGame

testPlayer and testBoard programs will test your Player and Board classes. They
do not require any input. You can find their outputs on the top level directory
(testPlayer.out, testBoard.out). For the testGame test you need both Game
and inputParser classes. It reads input from stdin and writes output to stdout.
Inputs and corresponding outputs reside on gameInputs and gameOutputs folders.
For the testPlayer test you may be printing the moveable coordinates in different
order, it is not an issue. You should be able to compare the results of other tests
with the diff program.
