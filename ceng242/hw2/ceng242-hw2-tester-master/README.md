# ceng242-hw2-tester
A primitive tester for ceng242 semester 2019-2 Hw2 written in haskell.

## How-to
Launch a terminal, and start the haskell interpreter ghci. Load the tester with :l test.hs and after both the tester and homework modules (hopefully) compile, whisper "help".

```
ghci

Prelude> :l test.hs

[1 of 2] Compiling Hw2              ( Hw2.hs, interpreted )

[2 of 2] Compiling Main             ( test.hs, interpreted )

Ok, two modules loaded.

*Main> help
```
