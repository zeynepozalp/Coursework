Homeworks given at DEpartment of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University.

ceng111 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER ENG. CONCEPTS:
The objective of the course is to lay the foundations of computers and computer programming . Starting with the history and basic theoretical aspects of computers and computing, this course provides students with basic knowledge of how computers work, how they can represent data, how algorithms can be developed and analyzed, and how they can be programmed to solve various tasks. Python is used as the primary programming language to illustrate various concepts.
  
ceng140 - C PROGRAMMING:
At the end of this course the students will be able to learn and use the C programming language to design and implement advanced computer programs.
  
ceng213 - DATA STRUCTURES:
At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to use appropriate data structures for the solution of a given problem. Students will also be able to design and implement abstract data types which use efficient algorithms to manipulate these data structures. Various concepts such as searching, sorting, and algorithm analysis are also introduced.
  
ceng223 - DISCRETE COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURES:
Fundamentals of logic, set theory, relations, functions, induction, graph theory, trees, introduction to algebraic structures, lattices.

ceng232 - LOGIC DESIGN:
This course provides the students with the necessary background for designing hardware intensive systems. It reviews basic principles of digital hardware design, including combinational and sequential circuits and optimization methods. It proceeds with design principles underlying digital systems from simple components to more complex systems. It covers the use of algorithmic state machines to solve complex sequencing systems and teaches the foundations of how computing systems work. The course is supported by applied laboratory components that support the learning and application of these components.

ceng242 - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CONCEPTS:
Evolution of programming languages. Overview of language translation, virtual machines, and run-time environments. Names, bindings and scopes. Values, expressions and types. Type compatibility and type checking. Storage, variables, and commands. Procedural abstraction. Generic units. Overview of functional programming paradigm. Overview of object-oriented programming paradigm: encapsulation, classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding.

ceng280 - FORMAL LANGU.AND ABSTRACT MACHINES:
Computer Science needs mathematical languages to abstract away from particulars of computing machinery and to concentrate on systematicity, capacity, and efficiency of computing in the abstract. Theory of formal languages studies such languages while automata theory studies their acceptors. Both theories have found scientific and practical use in all areas of computer science and engineering. In fact, description of any computational process can be recast in formal language theory or automata theory. From this perspective, the theory can be seen as a vehicle for communicating the ideas clearly and precisely among computer scientists.
