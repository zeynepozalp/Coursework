ceng111 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER ENG. CONCEPTS:
Introduction to fundamentals of computer systems, including computer organization, operating systems, language processors and user interfaces. Introduction to algorithms and programming. Reasoning informally about the correctness and efficiency of programs. A functional programming language will be used for practical work.
  
ceng140 - C PROGRAMMING:
At the end of this course the students will be able to learn and use the C programming language to design and implement advanced computer programs. Advanced programming with C: storage and control structures, recursion and programming with dynamic data structures. Homeworks are required to run on Unix environment.
  
ceng213 - DATA STRUCTURES:
At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to use appropriate data structures for the solution of a given problem. Students will also be able to design and implement abstract data types which use efficient algorithms to manipulate these data structures. Various concepts such as searching, sorting, and algorithm analysis are also introduced. Classification of data structures, space and time considerations. Linked lists, stacks and queues,priority queues. Array and pointer based implementations.Heaps and Tree structures, binary search trees,balanced AVL and red-black trees. Fundamentals of sorting and searching. Hash-tables and collision handling.Representation of graphs and introduction to graph algorithms.
  
ceng223 - DISCRETE COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURES:
Fundamentals of logic, set theory, relations, functions, induction, graph theory, trees, introduction to algebraic structures, lattices.

ceng232 - LOGIC DESIGN:
This course provides the students with the necessary background for designing hardware intensive systems. It reviews basic principles of digital hardware design, including combinational and sequential circuits and optimization methods. It proceeds with design principles underlying digital systems from simple components to more complex systems. It covers the use of algorithmic state machines to solve complex sequencing systems and teaches the foundations of how computing systems work. The course is supported by applied laboratory components that support the learning and application of these components. Introduction to computer architecture. Number systems. Boolean algebra. Logic gates and flip flops. Combinational and sequential circuit design. Registers, counters. Bus transfer. RAM, ROM units. Instruction execution and hardwired control.

ceng242 - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CONCEPTS:
To introduce the basic concepts and features of programming languages and different programming paradigms. Evolution of programming languages. Overview of language translation, virtual machines, and run-time environments. Names, bindings and scopes. Values, expressions and types. Type compatibility and type checking. Storage, variables, and commands. Procedural abstraction. Generic units. Overview of functional programming paradigm. Overview of object-oriented programming paradigm: encapsulation, classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding.

ceng280 - FORMAL LANGU.AND ABSTRACT MACHINES:
Computer Science needs mathematical languages to abstract away from particulars of computing machinery and to concentrate on systematicity, capacity, and efficiency of computing in the abstract. Theory of formal languages studies such languages while automata theory studies their acceptors. Both theories have found scientific and practical use in all areas of computer science and engineering. In fact, description of any computational process can be recast in formal language theory or automata theory. From this perspective, the theory can be seen as a vehicle for communicating the ideas clearly and precisely among computer scientists. Introduction to strings, languages and grammars. Concept of abstract machines and language acceptance. Deterministic and non-deterministic finite state machines. Regular expressions. Machines with pushdown tape. Turing Machines and recursive functions.
